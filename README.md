# Optimal_Vechile_Pricing
In this notebook We will build a Gradient Boost Regression model to predict price of automotive sector.

We will use Gradient Boost Regressor Algorithm a tree based bagging algortihm to predict the optimal Price of a vechile. We will see what hyperparan=meter need to optmize for this algorithm and how we can parse the best parameter by GridSearchCV
